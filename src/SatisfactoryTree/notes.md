# What we need

1. A way to represent the list of items
2. A way to represent the list of recipes
3. A way to represent the list of machines
4. A way to calculate the production needed for a given item, based on recipes, including the total number of machines needed for each step
5. A way to group types of items together by phase and factory. I think some of this will need to be hard coded.
